## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack confirmed: Python 3.11+, faster-whisper 1.2.1, sounddevice, Click, Flask, tomlkit
- Apple Silicon: use device="cpu", compute_type="int8" — CTranslate2 MPS is experimental
- Config path: ~/.mote/config.toml (REQUIREMENTS uses ~/.mote/, PROJECT.md context mentions ~/.config/mote/ — clarify at Phase 1 planning)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: src layout with packages=[src/mote] prevents hatchling auto-discovery installing as 'src' not 'mote'
- [Phase 01-foundation]: uv run --no-sync in Makefile: onnxruntime has no wheels for Intel Mac macOS 15; --no-sync skips env sync
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Python 3.13 venv: uv defaulted to 3.14 which onnxruntime doesn't support
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Env var override is in-memory only: OPENAI_API_KEY/MISTRAL_API_KEY never written back to config.toml
- [Phase 01-foundation]: set_config_value raises KeyError for unknown sections/keys to prevent silent config corruption
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Hatchling editable install requires reinstall after adding new source modules
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Use pytest pythonpath config (not PYTHONPATH env var or .pth file) to handle src layout on iCloud Drive paths with spaces — .pth processor silently skips paths containing spaces

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (Google Drive in research) is deferred to v2 in REQUIREMENTS.md — confirmed not in v1 scope
- Config path discrepancy between research (suggests ~/.config/mote/) and requirements (CFG-01 says ~/.mote/config.toml) — resolve at Phase 1 plan
