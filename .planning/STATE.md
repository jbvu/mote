## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack confirmed: Python 3.11+, faster-whisper 1.2.1, sounddevice, Click, Flask, tomlkit
- Apple Silicon: use device="cpu", compute_type="int8" — CTranslate2 MPS is experimental
- Config path: ~/.mote/config.toml (REQUIREMENTS uses ~/.mote/, PROJECT.md context mentions ~/.config/mote/ — clarify at Phase 1 planning)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (Google Drive in research) is deferred to v2 in REQUIREMENTS.md — confirmed not in v1 scope
- Config path discrepancy between research (suggests ~/.config/mote/) and requirements (CFG-01 says ~/.mote/config.toml) — resolve at Phase 1 plan
